### Hi there 👋

**Emarku/Emarku** is a ✨ _not_special_ ✨ repository because it's mine and I am not special, just a limited edition.

### About Me:

- 🔭 Currently brewing up some backend magic with Python, wrangling databases, and crafting AI solutions for Sustainability, Emissions, and Clean Energy.
- 🌱 On a mission to develop rock-solid software for Energy Insights in the EV market and to help companies reduce their carbon footprints.
- 👯 Open to collaborations on anything intriguing related to machine learning and LLMs (but keep it deployment-focused, research time is non-existent 😄).
- 💬 Ask me about anything... seriously, chatGPT is my homepage ;)
- 📫 Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erblin-marku/)
- 😄 Pronouns: Him/He
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Developers in the gaming industry are the happiest." I’m just an outlier...

### My Work and Interests:
- Backend Development with Python 🐍
- Building robust and scalable databases 🗄️
- Crafting AI simulations and chatbots with fine-tuned LLMs 🤖

### Let's Connect:
- Want to talk code, AI, or just share a laugh? Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erblin-marku/)
- Looking to collaborate? I’m all ears for cool projects, especially if they involve machine learning or AI deployments.

### Fun & Quirky:
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Developers in the gaming industry are the happiest." I’m just an outlier... but hey, we can't all be mainstream, right?

### GitHub Pro Tips:
- 🤖 When in doubt, automate. When not in doubt, still automate.
- 🧠 AI isn't just the future; it's the now. Dive in, get your hands dirty, and let's create something amazing.
- 🌱 Sustainability isn’t a buzzword; it’s a necessity. Code like the planet depends on it.
